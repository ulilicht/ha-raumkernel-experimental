## 1.2.18

- Add a separate "Eco mode" button per room, which puts the device into automatic standby (`EnterAutomaticStandby`) without affecting the existing "Off" button (`EnterManualStandby`).
- Add two new sensor entities per room: "Power status" (`Off` / `On` / `ECO mode`) and "Input" (current source: Streaming, Line-in, Optical, TV, Spotify, Radio).
- Track and broadcast the current "Source Select" value for soundbars/sounddecks, with periodic refresh to detect external changes (e.g. TV auto-switching to ARC).

## 1.2.17

- Use friendly source names in the UI for soundbar/sounddeck source selection: "Streaming", "Line-in", "Optical", "TV" (instead of the raw `Raumfeld`, `LineIn`, `OpticalIn`, `TV_ARC` values).

## 1.2.16

- Fix `selectSource` for Soundbars/Sounddecks: include `InstanceID` in `GetDeviceSetting`/`SetDeviceSetting` calls and target the physical room renderer instead of the virtual zone renderer.
- Add Line-in switching for devices that don't support `Source Select` but have a physical Line-in input (e.g. Stereo M/L/R speakers).

## 1.2.14

- Add `selectSource` support for Soundbars and Sounddecks (TV_ARC, OpticalIn).
- Update Integration to expose Source Select feature.
